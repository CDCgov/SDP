Ruby Docker images
==================

This repository contains the source for building various versions of a Ruby application as a
reproducible Docker image using [source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image).
Users can choose between RHEL and CentOS based builder images.  The resulting image can be run
using [Docker](http://docker.io).

These images are configured to work with MITRE's proxy server and SSL CA so that ruby gems can
be downloaded and github repositories can be cloned.

These images were developed to work with the builder pipeline inherent in an OpenShift cluster,
they can be used separately from OpenShift if you install the
[Source-to-Image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) tools.

For more information about using these images with OpenShift, please see the official
[OpenShift Documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/ruby.html).

Versions
---------------
Ruby versions currently provided are:
* ruby-2.0
* ruby-2.2
* ruby-2.3

RHEL versions currently supported are:
* RHEL7

CentOS versions currently supported are:
* CentOS7

A Ruby 1.9 image can be built from [this third party repository](https://github.com/getupcloud/s2i-ruby/).
It is not maintained by Red Hat nor is part of the OpenShift project.

Installation
---------------
To build a Ruby image, choose either the CentOS or RHEL based image:
*  **RHEL based image**

    To build a RHEL based Ruby image, you need to run the build on a properly
    subscribed RHEL machine.

    ```
    $ git clone https://gitlab.mitre.org/CDC-SDP/s2i-ruby-container.git
    $ cd s2i-ruby-container
    $ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.0
    ```

*  **CentOS based image**

    This image is available on DockerHub. To download it run:

    ```
    $ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7
    $ docker pull openshift/ruby-22-centos7
    $ docker pull openshift/ruby-23-centos7
    ```

    To build a Ruby image from scratch run:

    ```
    $ git clone https://gitlab.mitre.org/CDC-SDP/s2i-ruby-container.git
    $ cd s2i-ruby-container
    $ make build VERSION=2.0  # or VERSION=2.2, or VERSION=2.3
    ```

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed
on all provided versions of Ruby.**



Usage
---------------------------------

For information about usage of Dockerfile for Ruby 2.0,
see [usage documentation](2.0/README.md).

For information about usage of Dockerfile for Ruby 2.2,
see [usage documentation](2.2/README.md).

For information about usage of Dockerfile for Ruby 2.3,
see [usage documentation](2.3/README.md).


Test
---------------------
This repository also provides a [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework,
which launches tests to check functionality of a simple Ruby application built on top of the s2i-ruby image.

Users can choose between testing a Ruby test application based on a RHEL or CentOS image.

*  **RHEL based image**

    To test a RHEL7-based Ruby-2.0 image, you need to run the test on a properly
    subscribed RHEL machine.

    ```
    $ cd s2i-ruby-container
    $ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.0 # or VERSION=2.2, or VERSION=2.3
    ```

*  **CentOS based image**

    ```
    $ cd s2i-ruby-container
    $ make test VERSION=2.0 # or VERSION=2.2, or VERSION=2.3
    ```

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed
on all the provided versions of Ruby.**


Repository organization
------------------------
* **`<ruby-version>`**

    Dockerfile and scripts to build container images from.

* **`hack/`**

    Folder containing scripts which are responsible for build and test actions performed by the `Makefile`.
